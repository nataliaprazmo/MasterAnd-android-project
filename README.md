    -   After selecting all 4 colors, a **Check** button appears
-   **Feedback pegs** (shown as 4 small circles next to the guess):
    -   ‚ö™ **White** ‚Äî color not in the final sequence
    -   üü° **Yellow** ‚Äî color is in the final sequence, but wrong position
    -   üî¥ **Red** ‚Äî correct color in the correct position
-   **Highscore table**:
    -   Displays the **last obtained score**
